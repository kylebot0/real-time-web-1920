## API üêí
The data used throughout the application is from the Spotify API ```https://api.spotify.com/v1```.
It is a API that uses oAuth to connect the user. After you've succesfully connected you can search for basically everything within Spotify. 

To connect with oAuth, you first need to register your app at developer.spotify.com. After you've succesfully registered you should get a client code and a client secret. You should keep those safe in a .env file.

To make oAuth work you need to redirect to the spotify oAuth panel, where the user can login. After the user has logged in, you get a code in the parameters of the url. That code can be used to get your token which connects you to the spotify API.
